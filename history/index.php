			<p>In our seventh season, the team attended the Build Season kickoff and unveiling events at WPI in Worcester, MA. The team's robot was well recognized for its ability to shoot over the truss from across the field. The team competed at the NE FIRST Granite State District Event and the NE FIRST Pine Tree Distrct Event, where we received the Jugdes Award, due to the fact that our team mangaged to triple in size after we had only 7 key students remaining from the previous year. In the "Post Season" we participated in Worcester Polytechnic Institute's Battle Cry and Merrimack High School's Mayhem in Merrimack competitions. The team also worked very closely with Daniel Webster College to help coordinate and organize their seventh annual FLL tournament in the fall of 2013.<br><br>
            Lessons of the year:</p>
            <ol type="1">
               <li>Systems is important to build the robot before the deadline.</li>
            </ol>

			<p>In our sixth season, the team attended the BAE Systems kickoff and unveiling events in Manchester, NH. The team's robot was well recognized for the use of its <a href="http://www.team2342.org/images/history/2013/geneva-mechanism.avi" target="_blank">Geneva Mechanism</a> as a creative method of loading the frisbee and shooting it. The team competed at the BAE Systems Granite State Regional, where we received the Creativity Award, due to the use of a leaf blower in our shooting mechanism (<a href="http://www.team2342.org/images/history/2013/robot.avi" target="_blank">Robot Animation</a>). In the "Post Season" we participated in Worcester Polytechnic Institute's Battle Cry competition. The team also worked very closely with Daniel Webster College to help coordinate and organize their sixth annual FLL tournament in the fall of 2012.<br><br>
            Lessons of the year:</p>
            <ol type="1">
               <li>Jags are heavy, old, and they malfunction.</li>
               <li>You really need about a week of test time, we only had a day.</li>
			   <li>Most importantly: <b>Don't try and do everything!</b></li>
            </ol>
		 <p class="hangingHead">2008 Season</p>
			<p>In our first season, the team attended the BAE Systems kickoff and unveiling events at Nashua South High School.  The team's robot was well recognized for the use of a COTS (Commercial off-the-shelf) aluminum extension ladder as a simple but reliable method of lifting an exercise ball up and over the field obstacle. The team competed at the BAE Systems Granite State Regional, where we received the Rookie All-Star Award, qualifying the team to compete at the Championship competition in Atlanta.  We competed in the Championship and then returned to New England to participate in Worcester Polytechnic Institute's Battle Cry and Merrimack High School's Mayhem in Merrimack competitions.  The team also worked very closely with Daniel Webster College to help coordinate and organize their first FLL tournament in the fall of 2007.<br><br>
            Each year is a learning experience and the two key lessons learned that carry forward into today's Team 2342 robots include:</p>
            <ol type="1">
               <li>Center drive chassis are tricky to drive</li>
               <li>Positive control of appendages is required at all times - the ladder was powered up but relied on gravity to retract which was reliable until something unexpected adds friction, like another robot, field piece or wear & tear.</li>
            </ol>
